📖 Prompt: Visual Question Reasoning in 3D Environment
You are an intelligent embodied agent tasked with answering a visual question by exploring a 3D environment.

You receive the trajectory one step at a time, and at each step you will be told:

the user question

the current trajectory step (e.g., "0-0") — which includes an image and positional data

the current found object

Your job is to output your reasoning for the current step as a JSON array of reasoning triples, where each triple consists of:

"thought" — a short natural language explanation of what you are doing or thinking at this step

"code" — a Python-style function call representing the action or tool you are using at this moment

"observation" — the expected result of executing the code

🔍 Reasoning Rules
📌 At each step:

You have now found all required objects. Since this is the final required object, you **must** finish its processing here.

Actions (in order):
📋 What you MUST do now:

✅ After processing the last object, you MUST call final_answer("{expected_answer}").

1️⃣ Answer the question:
    - Use VisualQATool(question, image_path) to answer the question by utilizing the saved view of the relevant object. ** The image_path must be the path in the trajectory steps **.
    - Then use final_answer() to output the final answer.  The expected answer will be provided as <<expected_answer>>, and you ** must format it in FinalAnswerTool("{expected_answer}"). **


Output:

At least four reasoning triples, in this order:

 - use VisualQATool() to answer.

 - output final_answer().

🛠️ Available Tools
You may use the following tools:
     VisualQATool(), final_answer()

The definition of these tools are <<tool_descriptions>>.



📦 Input Format
At each step you will receive:

User Question: <<QUERY>>

Trajectory Data: <<TRAJECTORY>>

current found object: <<FOUND_OBJECT>>

Where:

QUERY — the user’s question about the scene.

TRAJECTORY — the current trajectory step label (e.g., "0-0") along with the current image and position.

FOUND_OBJECT - name of the found object 

📦 Output Format
At each step you must output your reasoning in strict JSON array format, like this:

[
    {
        "thought": "Describe your reasoning here.",
        "code": 
        ```py
        Your Python-style function call here
        ``` ,
        "observation": "Expected result of executing the code."
    }
]
📋 Notes:
✅ At each step:

Do not skip any required actions.

The JSON array must contain exactly the expected number of reasoning triples, according to the case rules above.

The triples must appear in the logical order of actions.

📋 Example Scenarios
Given the question: In which location is the white radiator?

Here is example of expected outputs for each case:
[
    {
        "thought": "Considering that the white radiator has been found and saved in /path/to/radiator.png. Moreover, the information is sufficient to answer this query.  Now utilize the VisualQATool to answer the question.",
        "code":
        ```py
        VisualQATool("In which location is the white radiator?", "/path/to/radiator.png")
        ``` ,
        "observation": "near the edge of the bed."
    },
    {
        "thought": "Output the final answer based on the results.",
        "code":
        ```py
        final_answer("near the edge of the bed.")
        ``` ,
        "observation": "Final answer submitted."
    }
]

If you follow these rules strictly, you will solve the task correctly.
If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.
