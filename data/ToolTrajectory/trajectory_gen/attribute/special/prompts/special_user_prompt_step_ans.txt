📖 Prompt: Visual Question Reasoning in 3D Environment
You are an intelligent embodied agent tasked with answering a visual question by exploring a 3D environment.

You receive the trajectory one step at a time, and at each step you will be told:

the user question

the current trajectory step (e.g., "0-0") — which includes an image and positional data

a flag found — whether a target object has been found at this step (true or false)

the current found object — provided only if found is true

a flag all_found — whether all required objects have already been found so far (true or false)

Your job is to output your reasoning for the current step as a JSON array of reasoning triples, where each triple consists of:

"thought" — a short natural language explanation of what you are doing or thinking at this step

"code" — a Python-style function call representing the action or tool you are using at this moment

"observation" — the expected result of executing the code

🔍 Reasoning Rules
📌 At each step:
✅ Case: found == false
You have not yet found any target object.

Action:

You are still navigating — invoke GoNextPointTool() to move to the next point.

Output:

Exactly one reasoning triple, with GoNextPointTool().

✅ Case: found == true and all_found == false
You have found a target object, but not all required objects yet.

Actions (in order):

1️⃣ Use at least one appropriate analysis tool (from the list below) to identify and locate the found target object, and return its bounding box.

- In the "thought" field: clearly describe your reasoning and what you **plan to do next** to identify and locate the target object.  
⚠️ Do NOT include any results, dimensions, bounding box, position, or any specific information about the object here — only your intention and reasoning.  
⚠️ You must assume you do NOT yet know the size, position, or bounding box of the object. Your reasoning should reflect this and focus on which tool(s) you intend to use and why.

- In the "code" field: call the appropriate tool(s) to carry out your plan.

- In the "observation" field: include the actual output after running the code.  
The bounding box in observation must be consistent with the provided object information in "the information of object".

2️⃣ Finally, you must still call GoNextPointTool() to continue exploring.

General Notes:
✅ In "thought", focus only on what you observe in the scene and which tool(s) you will use next. Do NOT assume or state any results here.  
✅ The purpose of "thought" is to demonstrate your reasoning for choosing a tool, NOT to report findings.  
✅ All findings must appear ONLY in the "observation" field after running the code.


Output:

At least three reasoning triples, in this order:

 - analyze/locate the target object.

 - navigate to the next point.

✅ Case: found == true and all_found == true
You have now found all required objects. Since this is the final required object, you **must** finish its processing here.

Actions (in order):
📋 What you MUST do now:
⚠️ Since all_found == true, you are NOT allowed to navigate to any next point, and you MUST complete processing and answering at this point. **The final tool you invoke must be FinalAnswerTool().**
🚫 Do NOT call GoNextPointTool() at this step — if you do, the task fails.
✅ After processing the last object, you MUST call final_answer("{expected_answer}").

1️⃣ Process the current object at this location:
    Use at least one appropriate analysis tool (from the list below) to identify and locate the found target object, and return its bounding box.
        - In the "thought" field: clearly describe your reasoning and what you **plan to do next** to identify and locate the target object.  
        ⚠️ Do NOT include any results, dimensions, bounding box, position, or any specific information about the object here — only your intention and reasoning.  
        ⚠️ You ** must assume you do NOT yet know the size, position, or bounding box of the object **. Your reasoning should reflect this and focus on which tool(s) you intend to use and why.

        - In the "code" field: call the appropriate tool(s) to carry out your plan.

        - In the "observation" field: include the actual output after running the code.  
        The bounding box in observation must be consistent with the provided object information in "the information of object".

2️⃣ Review the previous reasoning and actions:
    - Read `previous_thoughts`, which contains a summary of all previously located objects and their bounding boxes.
        - previous_thoughts are <<previous_thought>>
    - You **must carefully read and extract the relevant data of all required target objects from previous_thoughts.**
    - Confirm that after completing the current object, **all required target objects have been found, and the information of target has been provided.**
    - ⚠️ Note: all required target objects have already been found and this current object completes the set.
    
    In your thought:
    ✅ Explicitly state: “all required objects are now fully processed” after completing this step.
    ✅ Clearly identify what property needs to be compared (e.g., height, volume, etc.) based on the task.
    ✅ Explicitly list the relevant values of all required target objects **by reading them from previous_thoughts (not by guessing).**
    ✅ If calculation is needed (e.g., volume = L × W × H), show the calculation for each object explicitly.
    ✅ Then explicitly compare these values and clearly state which object meets the required condition.
    ✅ Do NOT assume any missing information — use exactly what is present in `previous_thoughts` and the current observation.

    In the `code` field:
        - Only after completing the above reasoning, provide the final answer based on your comparison.

3️⃣ Decide whether you now have sufficient information to answer the user question:
    - Since all objects have now been located and the information of target has been provided, you **do have sufficient information.**
    - If you incorrectly believe information is missing, explain why in your thought but proceed anyway — because the system guarantees all necessary data is present.

4️⃣ Answer the question:
    - Then use FinalAnswerTool() to output the final answer.  
    - ⚠️ Note: The expected answer will be provided as <<expected_answer>>, and you ** must format it in FinalAnswerTool("{expected_answer}"). **
    - The questions are about the size comparison between objects. The thought in this step must contain the comparison, and it must consistent with the final answer.

Output:

At least four reasoning triples, in this order:

 - analyze/locate the target object.

 - output FinalAnswerTool().

🛠️ Available Tools
You may use the following tools:
    GoNextPointTool(), ObjectLocation3D(), FinalAnswerTool()

The definition of these tools are <<tool_descriptions>>.



📦 Input Format
At each step you will receive:

User Question: <<QUERY>>

Trajectory Data: <<TRAJECTORY>>

found: <<FOUND>>

all_found: <<ALL_FOUND>>

current found object: <<FOUND_OBJECT>>

the information of object: <<INFORMATION_OBJECT>>

Where:

QUERY — the user’s question about the scene.

TRAJECTORY — the current trajectory step label (e.g., "0-0") along with the current image and position.

FOUND — true or false, whether a target object is found.

ALL_FOUND — true or false, whether all required objects have already been found.

FOUND_OBJECT - name of the found object. 

INFORMATION_OBJECT - information of the found object, namely its bounding box.

📦 Output Format
At each step you must output your reasoning in strict JSON array format, like this:

[
    {
        "thought": "Describe your reasoning here.",
        "code": 
        ```py
        Your Python-style function call here
        ``` ,
        "observation": "Expected result of executing the code."
    }
]
📋 Notes:
✅ At each step:

Do not skip any required actions.

The JSON array must contain exactly the expected number of reasoning triples, according to the case rules above.

The triples must appear in the logical order of actions.

📋 Example Scenarios
Given the question: Which object has a more vibrant color: the purple sofa positioned centrally, flanked by patterned cushions and a small side table or the dishwasher beneath the countertop next to the sink?

Here are examples of expected outputs for each case:

For the dresser: Length = 0.23, Width = 1.552, Height = 1.028.  Calculating the volume of the dresser: Volume_dresser = 0.23 × 1.552 × 1.028 = 0.366 m³ (approximately, calculating gives exactly 0.36609904). Now we compare the two volumes: Volume of the bed ≈ 2.495 m³, Volume of the dresser ≈ 0.366 m³. Since 2.495 > 0.366, the bed has a larger overall volume than the dresser.",

❌ Incorrect example at final step:
[
    …,
    {
        "thought": "Proceed to next point to find remaining objects.",
        "code": 
        ```py
        GoNextPointTool()
        ``` ,
        "observation": "Navigating to the next point in the 3D environment."
    }
]
⚠️ This is WRONG. You must NOT call GoNextPointTool() when all_found==true.

If you follow these rules strictly, you will solve the task correctly.
If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.
