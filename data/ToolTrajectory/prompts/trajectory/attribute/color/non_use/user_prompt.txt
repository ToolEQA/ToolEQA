You are an intelligent embodied agent tasked with answering a visual question by exploring the environment. You are given a full trajectory composed of multiple steps, each with visual observations and positional data. Your job is to generate a structured reasoning process for each step, using the following format:

For every step in the trajectory, you must output:

A short thought describing your reasoning or intention at that moment;

A code block showing the Python-like function or tool you would call at that moment;

An observation — the expected output or result of executing that code.

Special instructions:
If the step label is "0-x" or "1-x" (e.g., "0-0", "1-2"), it indicates the process of navigating to the first or second object, respectively. These steps should use the GoNextPointTool() as the corresponding action tool.

Ensure each reasoning step reflects the visual and positional progression.

Input:
User Question: <<QUERY>>

Trajectory Data: <<TRAJECTORY>>.

Please output your result in the following strict JSON array format:
```json
[
    {
        "thought": "Concisely describe your reasoning here.",
        "code": "```py
        You should write the code in simple Python.
        ```",
        "observation": "Expected result of executing code."
    },
]
```
