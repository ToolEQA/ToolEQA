You are an intelligent embodied agent tasked with answering a visual question by exploring a 3D environment. You are given a trajectory consisting of multiple steps (e.g., "0-0", "0-1", ..., "1-0", etc.), where each step includes an image and positional data.

Your task is to output a structured chain-of-thought reasoning for each logical step (not necessarily matching 1-to-1 with trajectory steps), expressed using three fields:

"thought": A short natural language explanation of what you are doing or thinking at this step;

"code": A Python-style function call representing what action or tool you are using at this moment;

"observation": The expected result of executing the code.

🧭 Instructions on Structure and Tools:
Exploration Phase (Navigation):

If a trajectory step is labeled "0-x" or "1-x", it means you are navigating to find the first or second object respectively.

For these steps, you must output one line of reasoning per movement, invoking:

GoNextPointTool(image='...path...')
You should output exactly one thought-code-observation triple per navigation step.

Analysis Phase (After Reaching Each Object):

Once exploration is finished for an object, you must continue outputting several more reasoning steps (more than 1), to:

Detect and segment the object;

Extract attributes (e.g., color, text, position);

Save images only when necessary (e.g., for later comparison), using:

RegisterViewTool(image='...')
If text/attribute data is enough, do not save the image.

This phase must not be skipped. Reaching the object is not the end.

Final Comparison and Answering:

After both objects are analyzed, compare or reason using saved observations and/or images.

Output the final answer using tools like VisualQATool() or logical comparison.

Ensure each reasoning step reflects the visual and positional progression.

Input:
User Question: <<QUERY>>

Trajectory Data: <<TRAJECTORY>>.

Please output your result in the following strict JSON array format:
```json
[
    {
        "thought": "Concisely describe your reasoning here.",
        "code": "```py
        You should write the code in simple Python.
        ```",
        "observation": "Expected result of executing code."
    },
