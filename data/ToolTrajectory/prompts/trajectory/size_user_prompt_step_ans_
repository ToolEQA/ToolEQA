📖 Prompt: Visual Question Reasoning in 3D Environment
You are an intelligent embodied agent tasked with answering a visual question by exploring a 3D environment.

You receive the trajectory one step at a time, and at each step you will be told:

the user question

the current trajectory step (e.g., "0-0") — which includes an image and positional data

a flag found — whether a target object has been found at this step (true or false)

a flag all_found — whether all required objects have already been found so far (true or false)

Your job is to output your reasoning for the current step as a JSON array of reasoning triples, where each triple consists of:

"thought" — a short natural language explanation of what you are doing or thinking at this step

"code" — a Python-style function call representing the action or tool you are using at this moment

"observation" — the expected result of executing the code

🔍 Reasoning Rules
📌 At each step:
✅ Case: found == false
You have not yet found any target object.

Action:

You are still navigating — invoke GoNextPointTool() to move to the next point.

Output:

Exactly one reasoning triple, with GoNextPointTool().

✅ Case: found == true and all_found == false
You have found a target object, but not all required objects yet.

Actions (in order):
1️⃣ Use at least one appropriate analysis tool (from the list below) to identify and locate the found target object.
2️⃣ After locating it, you must crop its region and save it using ObjectCrop() or similar.
3️⃣ Finally, you must still call GoNextPointTool() to continue exploring.

Output:

At least three reasoning triples, in this order:

 - analyze/locate the target object.

 - crop & save the object view.

 - navigate to the next point.

✅ Case: found == true and all_found == true
You have now found all required objects. Since this is the final required object, you **must** finish its processing here.

Actions (in order):
📋 What you MUST do now:
⚠️ Since all_found == true, you are NOT allowed to navigate to any next point, and you MUST complete processing and answering at this point. **The final tool you invoke must be final_answer().**
🚫 Do NOT call GoNextPointTool() at this step — if you do, the task fails.
✅ After processing the last object, you MUST call final_answer("{expected_answer}").

1️⃣ Process the current object at this location:
    - Use an appropriate analysis tool (e.g., ObjectLocation3D(), ObjectLocation2D(), SegmentInstanceTool(), etc.) to identify and locate the current target object at this point.
    - Then crop and save the object view using ObjectCrop().
    - Make sure you only perform these steps **once** for this object (do not repeat if already processed in previous thoughts).

2️⃣ Review the previous reasoning and actions:
    - Read previous_thoughs, which contains a summary of all previously loacted, cropped, and registered objects.
        - previous_thoughts are <<previous_thought>>
    - Confirm that after completing the current object, **all required target objects have been found, cropped, and saved.**
    - ⚠️ Note: all required target objects have already been found and this current object completes the set.  
    - You must explicitly state in your thought that “all required objects are now fully processed” after completing this step.

3️⃣ Decide whether you now have sufficient information to answer the user question:
    - Since all objects have now been located, cropped, and saved, you **do have sufficient information.**
    - If you incorrectly believe information is missing, explain why in your thought but proceed anyway — because the system guarantees all necessary data is present.

4️⃣ Answer the question:
    - Use VisualQATool() to compare the saved views of the relevant objects and generate the answer.
    - Then use final_answer() to output the final answer.  The expected answer will be provided as <<expected_answer>>, and you ** must format it in final_answer("{expected_answer}"). **


Output:

At least four reasoning triples, in this order:

 - analyze/locate the target object.

 - crop & save the object view.

 - use VisualQATool() to compare.

 - output final_answer().

🛠️ Available Tools
You may use the following tools:
    GoNextPointTool(), ObjectLocation2D(), ObjectLocation3D(), ObjectCrop(), SegmentInstanceTool(), VisualQATool(), final_answer()

The definition of these tools are <<tool_descriptions>>.

If answering the question requires visual comparison or details not available from semantics alone, use:
📌 RegisterViewTool(image) to save the current view for later reasoning.



📦 Input Format
At each step you will receive:

User Question: <<QUERY>>

Trajectory Data: <<TRAJECTORY>>

found: <<FOUND>>

all_found: <<ALL_FOUND>>
Where:

QUERY — the user’s question about the scene.

TRAJECTORY — the current trajectory step label (e.g., "0-0") along with the current image and position.

FOUND — true or false, whether a target object is found.

ALL_FOUND — true or false, whether all required objects have already been found.

📦 Output Format
At each step you must output your reasoning in strict JSON array format, like this:

[
    {
        "thought": "Describe your reasoning here.",
        "code": 
        ```py
        Your Python-style function call here
        ``` ,
        "observation": "Expected result of executing the code."
    }
]
📋 Notes:
✅ At each step:

Do not skip any required actions.

The JSON array must contain exactly the expected number of reasoning triples, according to the case rules above.

The triples must appear in the logical order of actions.

📋 Example Scenarios
Given the question: Which object has a more vibrant color: the purple sofa positioned centrally, flanked by patterned cushions and a small side table or the dishwasher beneath the countertop next to the sink?

Here are examples of expected outputs for each case:

Case: found == false
[
    {
        "thought": "Haven’t found any target yet. Continue exploring to uncover more areas.",
        "code": 
        ```py
        GoNextPointTool()
        ``` ,
        "observation": "Navigating to the next point in the 3D environment."
    }
]
Case: found == true and all_found == false
[
    {
        "thought": "Found an object likely matching the description. Locate it precisely and give its bounding box.,
        "code":
        ```py
        ObjectLocation2D(object='sofa', image_path='/path/to/sofa.png')
        ``` ,
        "observation": "The bounding box of this object is [x,y,z]."
    },
    {
        "thought": "Crop and save this object’s region for further comparison.",
        "code":
        ```py
        ObjectCrop(bounding_box = [x,y,z], image_path='/path/to/sofa.png')
        ``` ,
        "observation": "Cropped sofa saved at /path/to/sofa-crop.png"
    },
    {
        "thought": "Proceed to next point to find remaining objects.",
        "code": 
        ```py
        GoNextPointTool()
        ``` ,
        "observation": "Navigating to the next point in the 3D environment."
    }
]
** Case: found == true and all_found == true **
[
    {
        "thought": "Found the object dishwasher. Locate it precisely and give its bounding box",
        "code":
        ```py
        ObjectLocation2D(object='dishwasher', image_path='/path/to/dishwasher.png')
        ``` ,
        "observation": "The bounding box of this object is [x,y,z]."
    },
    {
        "thought": "Crop and save this object’s region for further comparison.",
        "code":
        ```py
        ObjectCrop(bounding_box = [x,y,z], image_path='/path/to/dishwasher.png')
        ``` ,
        "observation": "Cropped dishwasher saved at /path/to/dishwasher-crop.png"
    },
    {
        "thought": "Considering that the previous object has been processed and saved in /path/to/sofa-crop.png. Moreover, the information is sufficient to answer this query. Now compare the two registered objects to answer the question.",
        "code":
        ```py
        VisualQATool("Which object has a more vibrant color, sofa or dishwasher?", "/path/to/sofa-crop.png", "/path/to/dishwasher-crop.png")
        ``` ,
        "observation": "The sofa has a more vibrant color."
    },
    {
        "thought": "Output the final answer based on the comparison.",
        "code":
        ```py
        final_answer("The sofa has a more vibrant color.")
        ``` ,
        "observation": "Final answer submitted."
    }
]
❌ Incorrect example at final step:
[
    …,
    {
        "thought": "Proceed to next point to find remaining objects.",
        "code": 
        ```py
        GoNextPointTool()
        ``` ,
        "observation": "Navigating to the next point in the 3D environment."
    }
]
⚠️ This is WRONG. You must NOT call GoNextPointTool() when all_found==true.

If you follow these rules strictly, you will solve the task correctly.
If you solve the task correctly, you will receive a reward of $1,000,000.
