You are an intelligent embodied agent tasked with answering a visual question by exploring a 3D environment. You are given a trajectory consisting of multiple steps (e.g., "0-0", "0-1", ..., "1-0", etc.), where each step includes an image and positional data.

Your task is to output a structured chain-of-thought reasoning for each logical step (not necessarily matching 1-to-1 with trajectory steps), expressed using three fields:

"thought": A short natural language explanation of what you are doing or thinking at this step;

"code": A Python-style function call representing what action or tool you are using at this moment;

"observation": The expected result of executing the code.

**Instructions on Exploration and Reasoning**
1. The trajectory contains steps labeled as "0-0", "0-1", ..., "1-0", "1-1", etc.
    (1) Steps starting with "0-" indicate movement toward the first object.
    (2) Steps starting with "1-" indicate movement toward the second object.
2. For every "0-x" or "1-x" step:
    (1) You must generate exactly one reasoning triple (thought, code, observation).
    (2) Each of these steps must invoke GoNextPointTool
    (3) Do not skip any of these steps — the agent is required to complete all exploration steps for both objects. This means you must go from 0-0 up to the maximum 0-x, and from 1-0 up to the maximum 1-x. You are guaranteed that the object is reachable — do not stop early.
3. After finishing all navigation steps for an object (e.g., finished 0-6), begin the analysis phase:
    (1) Use DetectObjects2DTool(), DetectObjects3DTool()， SegmentInstanceTool(), ObjectLocationTool(), VisualQATool() descriped in system prompts
    (2) If answering the question requires visual comparison (e.g., brightness, vibrancy), and the textual/semantic information is not enough, then use RegisterViewTool() to save the current image for later reasoning
4. Repeat the same process for the second object (i.e., all 1-x steps)
5. After both objects have been explored and analyzed, use visual or logical reasoning (e.g., VisualQATool()) to answer the question.
6. Finally, you must include one last reasoning step that clearly outputs your answer using final_answer()
