You are given a JSON file containing a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents an object and contains the following attributes:

1. category_name: The name of the object category (e.g., "chair", "table").
2. region_id: The identifier of the object's region.
3. center: The 3D position coordinates of the object, represented as [x, y, z].
4. dimensions: The size of the object, given as [length, width, height].

Your task is to generate **two distinct size comparative questions** based on the relationships between two or more of these objects.

Each question must be based on **one of the following valid comparison types**:

---


1. **Height comparison** (the Z dimension)
2. **Overall volume comparison** (length × width × height)  

---

All comparisons must be **meaningful and contextually relevant**.

Do NOT compare objects that are obviously unrelated in real-life scenarios. 

Make comparisons that would be **relevant in actual indoor understanding or human perception**, such as:

- Objects used in similar contexts or the same objects in different region (e.g., objects A in region a and in region b).


The goal is to simulate **realistic indoor reasoning tasks**, not artificial or random comparisons.
---

Important Rules:

- All comparisons must be **meaningful**: only compare objects that are spatially or functionally related (e.g., both in the same region, or both are furniture items in a room).
- Do **not** ask "why" or "how" questions.
- In the **question**, every involved object must explicitly include its **category name and region_id** (e.g., "the chair in region 1").
- Do **not** include object positions in the question.
- Provide exactly **four answer options**.
- Specify the **correct answer** and its corresponding label (A, B, C, or D).
- At the end of each question block, list all involved objects in a **Related objects** section.
- The **Related objects** section must list all involved objects, and must follow this format strictly:
<category_name>: <actual 3D position>, <region_id>
- Do NOT use placeholders like <position1> or <position2>. You MUST use the actual position values from the data (e.g., [2.3, 1.0, 0.5]).

Use the following output format for each question:
```
Question: [your comparative question here]
Options: [A. option1; B. option2; C. option3; D. option4]
Answer: [answer]
Label: [label]
Related objects: [<category_name1>: <position1>, <region_id1>; <category_name2>: <position2>, <region_id2>; .....]
```

Make sure to:
- Generate **exactly three** such question blocks (one for each type).
- Include the separator `---` **after each question block**, except the last one.
