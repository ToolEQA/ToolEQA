Now, given images and corresponding information at each moment, each image provides a thought, a code, and an observation, exploring along the trajectory of the image and obtaining the final answer.

1. User Query: <<QUERY>>
2. Image Content: <<IMAGE_SEQUENCE>>

where IMAGE_SEQUENCE is the RGB information during the exploration process, each image represents the state of a moment.
Output MUST use the following json template to provide <<NUM_IMAGES>> thought, code and observation.
```json
[
    {
        "thought": "Concisely describe your reasoning here.",
        "code": "```py
        You should write the code in simple Python.
        ```",
        "observation": "Expected result of executing code."
    }
]
```
