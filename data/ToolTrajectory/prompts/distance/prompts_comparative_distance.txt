You are given a JSON file containing a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents an object and contains the following attributes:

1. category_name: The name of the object category (e.g., "chair", "table").
2. region_id: The identifier of the object's region.
3. center: The 3D position coordinates of the object, represented as [x, y, z].
4. dimensions: The size of the object, given as [length, width, height].
5. object_id: The id of the object.

Your task is to generate **three distinct comparative questions** based on the relationships between two or more of these objects.

Each question must be based on **one of the following valid comparison types**:

---


1. **Distance-based comparisons (2  objects)**
   - Ask about the relative distances **between pairs of objects**.
   - Valid question formats include:
     • “What is the distance between object A and object B?” (quantitative range as answer)
    
   - Questions **must include  2 objects**.

    - Answer format must be:
     • Quantitative ranges (e.g., “0–1m, 1–2m...”) for distance questions

2. **Distance-based comparisons  (3 objects)**
   - Ask about the relative distances **between pairs of objects**.
   - Valid question formats include:
     • “Which object (a or b) is closest/farest to [reference object]?”
    
   - Questions **must include  3 objects**.



3. **Positional hierarchy**  
   Compare whether an object is **above**, **below**, or **on top of** another object.

---



You must prioritize comparisons that involve objects **from different regions**, as long as they are contextually meaningful and not trivially answerable.

Encouraged examples include:
- Comparing two chairs from different regions to see which is closer to a relevant object (like a table).
- Determining whether a television in one region is positioned higher than a whiteboard in another region.
- Reasoning about whether a shelf in region 2 is above or below a lamp in region 4.

These cross-region comparisons are especially valuable because they reflect realistic indoor spatial reasoning tasks, like understanding object layout across rooms or levels.

Do NOT generate comparisons that are obviously answerable based on region layout alone (e.g., comparing the chair in region 1 and the chair in region 4 to a table in region 1 — the answer is obvious).

Make sure the question requires actual spatial reasoning to solve.
---


Important Rules:

- All comparisons must be **meaningful**: only compare objects that are spatially or functionally related .
- Do **not** ask "why" or "how" questions.
- In the **question**, every involved object must explicitly include its **category name**.
- Do **not** include ** region id ** in the question.
- Do **not** include object positions, object id in the question.
- Provide exactly **four answer options**.
- Specify the **correct answer** and its corresponding label (A, B, C, or D).
- At the end of each question block, list all involved objects in a **Related objects** section.
- The **Related objects** section must list all involved objects, and must follow this format strictly:
<category_name> (object_id): <actual 3D position>
- Do NOT use placeholders like <position1> or <position2>. You MUST use the actual position values from the data (e.g., [2.3, 1.0, 0.5]).

Use the following output format for each question:
```
Question: [your comparative question here]
Options: [A. option1; B. option2; C. option3; D. option4]
Answer: [answer]
Related objects: [<category_name1> (object_id1): <position1>; <category_name2> (object_id2): <position2>; .....]
```

Make sure to:
- Generate **exactly three** such question blocks (one for each type).
- Include the separator `---` **after each question block**, except the last one.
