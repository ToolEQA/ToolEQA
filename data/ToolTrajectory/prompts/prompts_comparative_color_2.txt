You are given a JSON file containing a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents an object and contains the following attributes:

1. object_id: The identifier of the objects.
2. category_name: The name of the object category (e.g., "chair", "table").
3. region_id: The identifier of the object's region.
4. center: The 3D position coordinates of the object, represented as [x, y, z].
5. dimensions: The size of the object, given as [length, width, height].

Your task is to generate **two distinct color comparative questions** based on the relationships between two or more of these objects.

Each question must be based on **one of the following valid comparison types**:

---

1. Color Comparison with different objects in the **same category**
2. Color Comparison with different objects in **different categories**

---

All comparisons must be **meaningful and contextually relevant**.

Do NOT compare objects that are obviously unrelated in real-life scenarios. 

Make comparisons that would be **relevant in actual indoor understanding or human perception**, such as:

- Do these two objects have similar color tones?
- Is the color of object A warmer than object B?
- Which object has a darker color:  object A or object B?

The goal is to simulate **realistic indoor reasoning tasks**, not artificial or random comparisons.

---

Important Rules:

- Avoid vague or open-ended questions such as "How does A compare with B?".
- All comparisons must be **explicit**, **specific**, and **judgment-based** (e.g., darker, brighter, more similar, etc.).
- Use clear visual perception terms such as **darker**, **lighter**, **more saturated**, **less vibrant**, **more similar**, etc.
- Do **not** ask "why" or "how" questions.
- In the **question**, every involved object must explicitly include its **category name and object_id**, the format must be ** "the bed (24)" **.
- Do **not** include object positions in the question.
- At the end of each question block, list all involved objects in a **Related objects** section.
- The **Related objects** section must list all involved objects, and must follow this format strictly:
<category_name> (<object_id>): <actual 3D position>
- Do NOT use placeholders like <position1> or <position2>. You MUST use the actual position values from the data (e.g., [2.3, 1.0, 0.5]).

Use the following output format for each question:

```
Question: [your comparative question here]
Related objects: [<category_name1> (object_id1): <position1>; <category_name2> (object_id2): <position2>; .....]
```

Make sure to:
- Generate **exactly two** such question blocks (one for each type).
- Include the separator `---` **after each question block**, except the last one.
